Objective/Assignment

Build a small iPhone application that queries Twitter for the mentions of @Peek.
The resulting tweets are to be displayed in a UITableView with refresh and paging support.
The project should take 6-10 hours of coding time - remember itâ€™s a demo and not a fully featured app!
Services

Initial launch: Fetch the latest set of Tweets containing the mention @Peek. Each table cell should contain:
A user avatar
A user name
The tweet itself
Pull to refresh: Fetch a fresh set of tweets.
Infinite scrolling: Fetch the next set of tweets.
Bonus requirements

Swipe to delete: In-memory delete via swiping a table cell.
Retweet: Retweeting a specific tweet with the logged in account.
Alternating row colors: Break up the list of tweets via alternating row colors.



Key Features:

Table cells dynamically scale to the length of tweets.

Swipe right on a table cell to retweet or delete the cell.

Added some test cases for the models and tableview. Can expand on all models but this is just a proof of concept.
